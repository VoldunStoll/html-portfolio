<h1>About Me</h1>
    <ul>
       <li><p>In my journey through college, I gradually came to the realization that pursuing a degree was not the right path for me. While I initially believed that earning a college degree would be essential for my career, I began to feel disconnected from many of the subjects I was studying. I found myself unable to engage fully in the administrative side of business, realizing that it wasn’t where my strengths or passions lay. The one exception, however, was in the fields of Principles of Statistics and Business Statistics. These subjects captivated me, sparking a deep interest that I knew would stay with me for life. Despite excelling in these areas, I made the difficult decision to leave college, feeling that I was better suited to learning through experience rather than traditional education.</p></li> 

        <p>After stepping away from college, I decided to explore different career opportunities, starting with a couple of years in a travel agency. Though the job offered me valuable insights into customer service and business operations, I still felt a sense of unfulfillment. My next move brought me to a coffee store, where I learned how to manage a small business on a more hands-on level. This experience of cooperating with a local business opened my eyes to the importance of practical, real-world skills and taught me about the inner workings of managing daily operations. It was here that I began to develop an interest in financial management, learning how to handle small budgets and making decisions that would keep the store profitable.</p>

        <li><p>Recognizing my growing interest in finance, I started to explore how to manage money more effectively through the concept of portfolio management. I delved into the percentages and strategies that make portfolios successful, which led me to apply some of my statistical knowledge from college. While doing this, I discovered that I had a natural ability for solving problems using tools like Excel and Google Spreadsheets. These tools allowed me to apply mathematical formulas, create budgets, and forecast trends with relative ease. The more I worked with these applications, the more I realized how much I enjoyed using data to solve practical problems and create efficient solutions.</p>

        <p>However, as my proficiency with Excel and Spreadsheets grew, I began to encounter their limitations. I started to see that many of the more complex problems I was facing required more powerful tools and techniques. This realization pushed me towards coding, mathematics, and database management. I found myself drawn to the precision and logic behind coding, where I could write scripts to automate tasks and solve data problems more effectively. From there, my interest in coding naturally led me into exploring more advanced areas such as AI deep learning, where I saw immense potential for growth and problem-solving. My journey toward understanding how to use data, automation, and AI to address real-world issues became my new focus.</p></li>

        <li> <p>At this point, I realized that to continue progressing, I needed to equip myself with new tools. My first step toward expanding my capabilities was diving into full-stack web development, where I could combine my skills in coding with business and finance knowledge to create more dynamic, scalable solutions. This new path aligned perfectly with my lifelong interest in statistics and problem-solving, while also allowing me to bring my analytical skills to bear on larger, more complex systems. My journey may have started with a college degree, but it is through self-discovery, real-world experience, and a desire to overcome limitations that I’ve found my true calling—solving complex problems through the integration of business, technology, and data analysis.</p></li>
